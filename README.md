# ALX AirBnB Project Documentation

This repository contains the technical and functional documentation for the AirBnB Clone Backend project, part of the ALX curriculum. It provides detailed specifications, diagrams, and user stories to guide the design and development of the system.

## Contents

* **Features & Functionalities** (`features-and-functionalities/`): Diagram and listing of core backend features.
* **Use Case Diagram** (`use-case-diagram/`): Visualization of actor interactions and system use cases.
* **User Stories** (`user-stories/`): User stories derived from the use case diagram.
* **Data Flow Diagram** (`data-flow-diagram/`): High-level DFD showing data movement among services.
* **Flowcharts** (`flowcharts/`): Process flowchart for the property booking workflow.
* **Requirements** (`requirements.md`): Technical and functional spec for key backend features.

## Getting Started

Use these documents to understand the system’s architecture, API design, and workflow before implementation:

1. Review **Features & Functionalities** to see what the backend must support.
2. Examine the **Use Case Diagram** for user-system interaction flows.
3. Read the **User Stories** to convert use cases into actionable items.
4. Consult the **Data Flow Diagram** for data exchange details.
5. Follow the **Flowcharts** to see step-by-step process flows.
6. Use **Requirements.md** for API specs, validation rules, and performance criteria.
