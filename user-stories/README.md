# User Stories

**Objective:**  
Translate use case diagram interactions into user stories.

**Instructions:**  

- Using the use case diagram from Task 1, convert each use case into a relevant user story.  
- Example: “As a user, I want to be able to register an account so that I can list my properties.”  
- Write at least 5 user stories that capture the core interactions from the use case diagram.  
- Create a file named `user-stories.md` in the `user-stories/` directory of this repo and document your stories there.  
- Commit and push your changes to GitHub.
